# SimpleCounter

Idle tap games track the number of times a user has tapped on the screen, and allow users to accumulate points that can be exchanged for upgrades.

Application Features
Required Features

A simple version of the app with core features implemented will just track the number of times a user has tapped on a button:

User can see a number displayed on the screen. The number starts at 0.
User can tap on a button to see the number displayed increase by 1.

Stretch Features

The stretch features will help develop this app into something closer to an idle tap game, where users can see customizations and purchase upgrades.

User can exchange number of taps accumulated for upgrades:
Ideas for possible upgrades:
User can exchange 100 taps for an upgrade where each tap will count as 2 taps
User can exchange 100 taps for an icon button instead of the standard one.
 Customize the app with a theme. For example, you can have a dog background and a paw print button to give your app a dog theme.
(Extra challenge) User has increasingly difficult goals to reach in terms of number of taps accumulated. Each goal is displayed on the screen until the next goal is reached, and user can see how many goals they've reached in total.
